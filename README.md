🧑‍💻 Tayza-lab – CMP242
👋 About
This repository contains my CMP242 class work.
It includes Python programs, exercises, and reference materials I completed as part of the course.

🎯 What I Learned
Writing Python programs using classes and objects
Handling exceptions and errors
Organizing code into multiple files (car.py, student.py, etc.)
Running programs from a main file (main.py)
Using PDF notes (Foundation of SWE pdf.pdf) to support learning

⚙️ How to Run
Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
Navigate to the repository folder.
Run the main program:
python main.py
Check other files (car.py, student.py, exception.py) for individual examples.

💡 Reflection
This repository helped me practice programming concepts such as OOP, exception handling, and modular design.
It also taught me how to organize multiple Python files and run them together in a single project.
